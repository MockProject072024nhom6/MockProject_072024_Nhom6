        question: "What Is an Enterprise Security Guard?",
        answer: `<p className="text-[16px]"><span className="text-header underline">Planning a event </span> is a huge responsibility, especially if you’re expecting a great number of people. There are many aspects that can get overlooked in the overwhelming details of making sure everything is perfect. One that often does is meeting the utmost safety standards to ensure everything goes smoothly.</p>
                  <p className="font-bold leading-10">Hosting Big Enterprises</p>
                  <p>This is where specialized enterprise security comes in. If you’re hosting a big enterprise such as a concert or a conference, you should consider hiring a security company. When hosting an enterprise, you need a strategy that includes a plan for worst-case scenarios. This one seemingly small detail, though often ignored, does a great deal for the peace of mind of your guests. It also keeps everyone safe and calm when an unforeseen emergency occurs.</p>
                  <p>An enterprise security guard’s job is to help you prepare for every possible issue that may arise during the enterprise. They are trained professionals that know how to handle any safety problem and to maintain control at all times. They control the crowd and prevent uninvited guests from entering the facility.</p>
                  <p className="text-bold leading-6">Armed or Unarmed Enterprise Security</p>
                  <p>Security guards are mandatory at some venues and they can be armed or unarmed. They also carry a walkie-talkie to maintain communication and keep perimeters secure at all times. The type of security services you need at your enterprise depends on the type and the size of the enterprise you’re planning. It is generally recommended that you hire armed security guards if you’re hosting a large-scale enterprise.</p>
