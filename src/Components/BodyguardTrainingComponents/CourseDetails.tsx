      <p className='pb-5 font-extrabold text-2xl'>Why Do Security Guards in Florida Need a G Firearm License Class?</p>
      <p className='pb-5'>
        Security students who want to work as armed security guards and openly carry a gun while on duty are required to
        pass the 28-hour training (typically no longer than 3 days) and obtain a Class G license. Why are they required
        to obtain this license? The law in Florida requires all security guards or bodyguards who want to work in armed
        capacity to obtain Class G license which allows them to carry firearms while on duty. Security guards cannot
        provide armed security services with a concealed firearms license as it is meant for personal use only. They
        must receive firearms training, pass the written exam, and the firearms range qualification in order to qualify
        for the license. As armed security guards, they will be using weapons on the job and so they must acquire the
        necessary skills in using weaponry. The position of an armed security guard is a responsible one that often
        involves making difficult decisions such as drawing a gun and potentially shooting a suspect. This requires
        excellent skills in the use of firearms such as firearm mechanics, malfunctions, as well as critical thinking.
